Hey everyone! Welcome to the first of my many personal coding projects this summer. This is an automatic ticket generator which will hopefully prove useful to the raffle hosters on HEX ;)

## Features

- **Automatic Ticket Allocation**: Converts purchase amounts to ticket ranges
- **Stats**: Calculates total tickets and participants
- **Themed Design**: Dark mode with gold/serif accents (HEX-inspired!)
- **Designed For HEX**: Utilizes the forum's exact purchase log format

## How to Use

1. **Paste Purchase Data**:
   - Copy the raw purchase history from HEXRPG (tab-delimited format) (IF YOU CHANGE THE FORMAT, TICKETS WON'T BE COUNTED)
   - Paste into the input box

2. **Set Ticket Price**:
   - Enter the cost per ticket in Galleons (e.g., `100000`)

3. **Generate**:
   - Click the button to process the data

4. **View Results**:
   - See total tickets sold and participant count
   - Get formatted list of `Username - TicketRanges`

5. **Any Questions, Concerns, Suggestions?**
